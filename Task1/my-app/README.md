# React Course - Task 1: Understanding React Fundamentals

This project was created using **Vite** with React and TypeScript template as part of a comprehensive React learning course. This README explains the core concepts covered in our React fundamentals lessons.

## 🚀 Project Setup

This project was initialized with:
```bash
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts
```

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+ (Vite requirement)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation & Running
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 📚 Core React Concepts Covered

### 1. React Hooks Overview

Hooks give function components state, lifecycle logic, and performance control. They are the modern way to work with React components.

**Key hooks for everyday development:**

- `useState` – local component state
- `useEffect` – side effects (API calls, subscriptions, timers)
- `useReducer` – complex state and multiple actions
- `useMemo` – memorized derived or expensive values
- `useCallback` – stable callbacks for performance-sensitive children

---

## 🎯 Detailed Hook Explanations

### useState - State Management

`useState` is used to manage local component state. It allows functional components to have state that can change over time.

```tsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

**What this means:**
- `count` = current value
- `setCount` = function to update the value
- React re-renders when state changes

**Use cases:** Form inputs, toggles, counters, user selections, etc.

---

### useEffect - Side Effects

`useEffect` runs code after the component renders. Think of it as "what to do after the screen loads" or "what to do when data changes."

#### Dependency Array Patterns:

| Dependency Type | What Happens | Example |
|----------------|--------------|---------|
| `[]` (empty) | Runs once when component mounts | `useEffect(() => fetchData(), [])` |
| No array | Runs after every render | `useEffect(() => console.log("render"))` |
| `[value]` | Runs only when dependencies change | `useEffect(() => updateTitle(), [title])` |

**Common use cases:**
- ✅ API calls
- ✅ Timers (setInterval, setTimeout)
- ✅ Event listeners
- ✅ DOM updates

**Why dependency arrays matter:**
- Controls when the effect runs
- Prevents infinite loops
- Optimizes performance

---

### useReducer - Complex State Logic

`useReducer` is designed for cases where state logic becomes complex, or when there are multiple actions that modify the same state. Think of it as "mini Redux" within a component.

```tsx
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });
```

#### How it works:

1. **Initial State**: `{ count: 0 }` - starting state
2. **state**: Current state value
3. **dispatch**: Function to send actions
4. **reducer**: Function that decides how state changes

#### Action Flow:
```
Component calls: dispatch({ type: 'increment' })
↓
Action goes to reducer
↓
Reducer decides new state value
↓
React updates state → triggers re-render
```

**When to use useReducer over useState:**
- Complex forms with many fields
- Authentication logic (LOGIN, LOGOUT, ERROR, LOADING states)
- UI with multiple related actions

---

### useMemo - Performance Optimization

`useMemo` helps improve performance by memoizing (remembering) the result of expensive calculations, so they don't recalculate on every render.

#### Without useMemo:
```tsx
const number = expensiveFunction(); // Runs on every render (610ms)
```

#### With useMemo:
```tsx
const memoizedNumber = useMemo(() => expensiveFunction(), []); // Runs once (102ms)
```

**What happens:**
- If dependencies haven't changed → React uses saved result
- Saves time and processing power
- Only recalculates when dependencies change

**Use cases:**
- ✅ Heavy calculations
- ✅ Filtering/sorting large lists
- ✅ Creating derived values from state

---

### useCallback - Stable Function References

`useCallback` prevents the creation of new functions on every render. It returns the same function reference between renders as long as dependencies don't change.

```tsx
const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
  console.log("Clicked");
}, [value]);
```

**Why it's useful:**

#### 1. Prevents Unnecessary Child Re-renders
When passing functions to child components as props:
```tsx
<Child onClick={handleClick} />
```
- Without `useCallback`: New function created each render → Child thinks props changed → Unnecessary re-render
- With `useCallback`: Same function reference → Child doesn't re-render unnecessarily

#### 2. Works Great with React.memo
- `React.memo` prevents child re-renders when props haven't changed
- `useCallback` ensures function props stay stable
- Together they provide significant performance improvements

**When to use:**
- ✅ Passing functions to child components
- ✅ Lists with items that have event handlers
- ✅ Performance-sensitive components

## 🆕 React 19 New Features

React 19 introduces new hooks specifically designed for forms, async actions, and modern UX patterns:

### useActionState
Wraps form actions and helps you:
- Get the last result of the action (error messages, server data)
- Know if the action is pending
- Makes form submission easier and clearer

### useFormStatus
Allows any component within a form to know:
- If the form is currently being submitted
- Loading/submitting state
- Success or failure status
Without passing props to every child component.

### useOptimistic
Enables **Optimistic UI** updates:
- Updates UI immediately before server responds
- Shows changes "as if successful"
- If server returns error, reverts to original state
- Makes apps feel instant and smooth

**Note:** These hooks are taught later in the course when working with real forms and server data.

## 🧭 React Router - Navigation

React Router enables React applications to have multiple "pages" without full page reloads, creating a smooth Single Page Application (SPA) experience.

### Why React Router?

#### ✅ Instant Navigation
- Page transitions happen immediately
- No browser reload
- Smooth and fast user experience

#### ✅ State Preservation
- Since browser doesn't reload, all application state stays in memory
- Form data persists when navigating between pages
- Better user experience than traditional multi-page apps

#### ✅ Advanced Routing Features
- **Nested Routes**: Routes within routes (`/dashboard/users`)
- **Protected Routes**: Pages only for authenticated users
- **Dynamic URLs**: URLs with variables (`/products/123`)

### Basic Setup

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

### Basic Routing Example

```tsx
<BrowserRouter>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
    <Route path="/profile" element={<Profile />} />
  </Routes>
</BrowserRouter>
```

#### Component Breakdown:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `<BrowserRouter>` | Enables navigation for the entire app |
| `<Routes>` | Container for all possible routes |
| `<Route>` | Connects URL path to component |

#### How it works:
1. User clicks link → URL changes
2. Browser doesn't reload page
3. React Router looks at URL
4. Finds matching Route
5. Displays correct component
6. Everything happens client-side = instant

- **Declarative**: Describe how UI should look, React handles updates
- **Component-based**: Build UI from small, reusable pieces
- Results in readable, organized, maintainable code

### ✅ Vite is the fastest and easiest way to start a React application
- Modern development tool replacing Create React App
- Significantly faster development experience
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- Easy configuration

### ✅ Nx is the enterprise solution for large teams and scalable architecture
- Monorepo management tool
- Code sharing between applications
- Fast builds with caching
- Organized architecture for large teams

### ✅ Core Hooks power real-world React logic
- `useState` → Local state management
- `useEffect` → API calls and side effects
- `useReducer` → Complex logic with multiple actions
- `useMemo` → Performance optimization for expensive calculations
- `useCallback` → Prevents unnecessary function recreation

### ✅ React Router adds modern multi-page navigation without page reloads
- No full browser refresh
- Much faster and smoother
- Supports dynamic routes, protection, and nested routing
- Creates SPA that feels like a traditional multi-page website

## 🏆 Final Goal

**React enables building applications that are fast, reusable, scalable and maintainable.**

React allows you to build applications that are:
- **Fast**: Optimized rendering and performance
- **Reusable**: Component-based architecture
- **Scalable**: Handles complex applications
- **Maintainable**: Clean, organized code structure

This is why React is one of the most popular libraries in the world for front-end development.
