## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Run Individual Projects

Each project is completely independent:

```bash
# Homework 1
cd homework1-react-fundamentals
npm install
npm run dev
# Opens on http://localhost:5173

# Homework 2 (in new terminal)
cd homework2-react-query
npm install  
npm run dev
# Opens on http://localhost:5174 (different port)
```

### Option 2: Run Both Simultaneously

You can run both projects at the same time in separate terminals. They'll automatically use different ports.

## 💡 Why Separate Projects?

✅ **Complete Isolation** - Each homework is independent
✅ **Different Dependencies** - Can use different versions if needed  
✅ **Portfolio Ready** - Each project can be deployed separately
✅ **Real-World Structure** - Mimics actual project organization
✅ **Clean Boundaries** - No mixing of different homework code

## 🏗️ Project Organization

Each homework project follows the same structure:

```
homework-X/

│   ├── components/
│   ├── pages/
│   ├── App.tsx
│   └── main.tsx
├── public/
